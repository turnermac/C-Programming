Geany Themes README
===================

*IMPORTANT: ALL USERS*
----------------------
The color schemes here are only compatible with Geany 0.21 and no other
versions. Check your version of Geany by checking the `About` dialog in the
`Help` menu.

*IMPORTANT: UBUNTU/UNITY USERS*
-------------------------------
There is a conflict in Geany's code when you are using Unity's DBUS menu (that
global menu at the top of the screen). The fix for this will be available in
the 1.22 Geany release. To work around the problem, you can ensure that the
environment variable `UBUNTU_MENUPROXY` is set to `0` before running Geany.
This will disable Unity from stealing Geany's main menu and will leave it
within Geany's main window. You should be able to edit your launchers for
Geany to run like this `UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 geany`. You can even make a Bash
alias if you wish.

Unix-like Installation
----------------------

Extract the tarball and copy all of the files in the `colorschemes` directory
to your `~/.config/geany/colorschemes/` directory and then copy all of the
files in the `filedefs` directory into your `~/.config/geany/filedefs/`
directory. Create either of those two directories if they don't already exist.

Windows Installation
--------------------

Extract the tarball and copy all of the files in the `colorschemes` directory
to your `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\geany\colorschemes` directory
and then copy all of the files in the `filedefs` directory into your
`C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\geany\filedefs` directory. Create either
of those two directories if they don't already exist.

_Note:_ The Windows directory paths above are for Windows 7, they might be
different for other Windows versions (see the Geany manual).

_Note:_ Both of the above instructions will want to over-write your existing
colorschemes and filedefs which you might have customized. Be sure to backup
any files in those directories that you do not want over-written.

_Note:_ This 0.21 release will no longer be maintained, so please check for
newer releases of Geany and Geany Themes if you wish for improvements.
